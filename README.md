# 🔐 iLocker - Food Delivery Locler System

This project presents an IoT-based Smart Food Locker system designed using ESP32 and embedded sensors for secure, contactless food delivery. It allows delivery personnel to deposit food in lockers, and users can unlock them remotely using a unique access code.
An embedded system project that develops a smart food locker system using ESP32, sensors, and IoT-based access control for secure and contactless food delivery.

## 🔍 Project Description
The iLocker - Food Delivery Locler System provides a solution for hygienic, contact-free food delivery using smart embedded technology. Users are assigned unique access codes, which they can enter through a keypad to unlock their designated food locker. The system combines sensors, security mechanisms, and optional cloud integration for enhanced functionality.

## 📌 Features
- ESP32-based microcontroller with Wi-Fi capability
- Keypad for PIN input
- Solenoid lock for locker security
- LCD display for user interaction
- IR sensor for presence detection
- Temperature sensor for environment monitoring
- Cloud integration for remote access (optional)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
- Sensors (IR, Temperature)
- LCD + Keypad
- Solenoid Lock
- Firebase / MQTT (optional)
